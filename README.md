## Description:
A collaborative turn-based text storytelling game for 2-4 players. The “talespinner” supplies a randomized genre and some random items or characters for a player to use in the first line of the tale. Then that player gives the next player a new story element that they must incorporate in the next line of the tale.

## User Story:

```
AS A lonely human seeking fun in these post-apocalyptic covid times
I WANT to be able to create a story with my friends from afar, so that we can laugh and have fun and forget how miserable we are, with no pressure to be super creative
WHEN I start the application 
THEN I am presented with the home page, showing the title of the app and its use, including a start button 
WHEN I click the start button
THEN I am taken to a page where I can create or join a lobby, of up to 4 players, with the option to enter in my name
WHEN I have at least 2 players in a lobby, I can hit start game
THEN I am taken to another page where I am presented with a prompt box, where the app will present us with an assigned genre, a setting, an object, and a character.
WHEN the app has assigned the elements
THEN Player 1 writes 2-3 sentences to start the story with a given timeframe
WHEN Player 1 hits submit
THEN their sentences appear on the right side of the page, in the written story section for all players to see
WHEN player 1 has submitted their sentences
THEN Player 1 is prompted to create 1-2 elements, such as a character, object, or setting for the next player to use
WHEN player 1 has entered in their chosen elements
THEN Player 2 will create the next 3 sentences, using the elements Player 1 has chosen, which appear on the right side of the page, in the written story section for all players to see
WHEN Player 2 has finished typing their sentences
THEN Player 2 is prompted to create 1-2 elements, such as a character, object, or setting for the next player to use
WHEN It is not my turn 
THEN I can chat in the chat box with the other players, while I wait 
WHEN all players have had their turn
THEN the entire story will be unfolded in the written story section
